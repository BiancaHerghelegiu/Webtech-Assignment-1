# Given that 
 - the `distance` function receives as parameters two arrays
 - each element can appear in each array at most once; any duplicates are ignored
 - the distance between the 2 arrays is the number of different elements between them
 - if the parameters are not arrays an exception is thrown (`InvalidType`)

# Complete the following tasks
 - `distance` correctly returns the result for 2 arrays (20%)
 - `distance` correctly ignores duplicate elements (20%)
 - `distance` correctly throws `InvalidType` if one of the parameters is not an array (20%)
 - `distance` correctly returns 0 when comparing empty arrays (20%)
 - `distance` correctly differentiates between numbers and strings representing numbers (20%)
